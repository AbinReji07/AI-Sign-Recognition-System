# AI-Sign-Recognition-System
This project is a real-time Sign Language Recognition system using MediaPipe and a trained ML model. It captures hand landmarks via webcam, extracts features, and predicts the sign using a classifier. It enables gesture-based communication and can be extended for translation and accessibility tools.
